Composite Keys

    - When we query we'd like to be able to combine our indexes ad hoc and get the right results. Consider this table:

        segments
          data_source_id
          start_time

      We'd like to be able to query by time AND data_source_id.

          index_segments_e130c4f6-a12c-4152-8f7f-4f59173fb492_1469397588523
          index_segments_e130c4f6-a12c-4152-8f7f-4f59173fb492_1469397939234

      Solution - LMDB lets you provide cmp() function. Write a comparison function that overwrites the parts of the
                 key that are unused by a particular query.

                 Example: if a query specifiec time only, overwrite the data_soure_id part all incoming keys with
                 spaces.
